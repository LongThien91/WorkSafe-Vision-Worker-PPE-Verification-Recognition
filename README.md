# WorkSafe-Vision-Worker-PPE-Verification-Recognition  
 Project uses video or image streams to monitor workersâ€™ compliance with personal protective equipment (PPE) requirements. The system applies instance segmentation to detect individual workers, checks for safety vests and hard hats, and if non-compliance is detected, performs facial recognition to identify the worker.
